# The Storyboard - Collaborative Story Telling by Team O Tree
This website is one where anyone with an account can start a story with a prompt. Then, other users will have the ability to add exactly one contribution to the story. Users contributing will only be able to see the last entry added in a story. Contributors to a story will be able to see the stories they've contributed to in full.
## Roster:
 * Ivan Lam -- Managing html pages and how they render.
